    <h3>Final Project</h3>
    <p>My goal for my final project was to track the difference in academic careers between artists born in 1970 and artists born after 1986. Although I was not able to 
        track for this state change, I did manage to sort how 173 artists' educational paths in the MoMa's collection intersected.
